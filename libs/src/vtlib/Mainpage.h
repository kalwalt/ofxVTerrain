\section Overview Overview
 <b>vtlib</b> is a scene graph library built on top of <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg">OpenSceneGraph</a>
 and the <a href="../vtdata/index.html">vtdata</a> library which handles many kinds of
 geospatial data.  It extends <b>vtdata</b> with the ability to create 3D geometry
 of the geodata for interactive visualization.

 It is part of the <a href="http://vterrain.org/">Virtual Terrain Project</a>
 and distributed under a completely free <a href="../license.txt">open
 source license</a>.

 Because it is higher-level, <b>vtlib</b> lets you construct 3D geometry
 and simulations much faster and easier than using lower-level libraries
 like OSG and OpenGL directly.

 In addition to these automatically generated pages, programmer documentation
 for vtlib is also <a href="../vtlib.html">available online</a>.
