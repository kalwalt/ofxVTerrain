Original author "lkrann" says:
- The exterior of this model is fully mapped and textured. The interior not yet.
- Included in the ZIP-file is the texture and the opacity/alpha texture (both a 512x512 TGA).
- This model is available in both 3DS and MAX (r5) format.
This model is free for download and you can do with it whatever you want. I had fun making it and hope that you'll find some good use for it.  If you make something cool with it I'd love to hear about it... tube@xs4all.nl
